## ðŸ¤– Building a Chatbot Using Python, NLTK, and TensorFlow

In this project, weâ€™re creating a simple chatbot using **Python**, **NLTK**, and **TensorFlow**. This chatbot can detect the intent of a userâ€™s message and respond accordingly, and the best part is, its functionality can be enhanced further. Ready to build your own chatbot? Letâ€™s dive in! ðŸ’¬ðŸ¤–

## Project Overview

Weâ€™ll develop a chatbot that can respond to user messages based on categorized intents. The chatbot will be trained on a dataset of patterns and responses, where weâ€™ll use **Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK)** to handle tasks like tokenization and lemmatization. Then, weâ€™ll use **TensorFlow** to build and train a deep learning model that powers the chatbotâ€™s responses. The model will use a **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** network to detect user intent and provide a relevant response from the dataset.

By the end of this project, youâ€™ll have a chatbot that can be easily expanded with new intents and responses!

### Key Features:

- ðŸ’¬ **Intent Detection**: Use a trained neural network to detect the intent behind a userâ€™s message.
- ðŸ§  **Deep Learning Model**: Build and train an LSTM-based model to power the chatbot.
- ðŸ”„ **Text Processing**: Tokenize and lemmatize text data using **NLTK** for better language understanding.
- ðŸ’¾ **Model Persistence**: Save, reload, and use the trained model for future chatbot interactions.

## ðŸ›  Technologies Used

- **Python**: Core programming language for the project.
- **NLTK**: For natural language processing tasks like tokenization and lemmatization.
- **TensorFlow**: For building and training the deep learning model.
- **Pillow**: For image handling, if needed in future enhancements.

## ðŸ¤– Skills Applied

- Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Deep Learning
- Chatbot Development

## Example Tasks You Can Do

- **Chat with the Bot**: Input text and get relevant responses based on intent.
- **Train a Model**: Build and train an LSTM model to classify user intents.
- **Text Processing**: Use NLTK to tokenize and preprocess text before feeding it into the model.
